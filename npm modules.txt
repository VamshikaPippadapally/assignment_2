Modules in node.js:
--------------------
->Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files .
->As every module has its own context,it doesn;t interfere with other modules.
->each and every module must be placed under different .js files and different folders.
->this effecient way provides us for reusing the modules in nodejs.

basically modules in nodejs are classified into three types. They are core modules, local modules and thirdparty modules.
->Core Modules:
---------------
here are some of the core modules in node.js:
http, url, querystring, path, fs, util. 
In order to use Node.js core or npm modules, you first need to import it using require() function.
var module=require('mod_name');
->Node.js has a built-in module called HTTP, which allows Node.js to transfer data over the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
To include the HTTP module, use the require() method:
var http = require('http');

->Local Modules:
----------------
Local modules are modules created locally in your Node.js application.
These modules include different functionalities of your application in separate files and folders.
Create a module with name (name) and save it as name.js and export it.
Var mymodule=require('./name.js');


some of the built-in-modules which are available in node.js are assert,buffer,http,https,net,child_process,cluster,crypto,dgram etc.
