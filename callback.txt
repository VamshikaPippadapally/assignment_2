-> callback is a way to implement asynchronous nature in node js.
-> A callback is a function called at the completion of a given task; this prevents any blocking, and allows other code to be run in the meantime.
-> A JavaScript Callback Function is a function that is passed as a parameter to another JavaScript function, and the callback function is run inside of the function it was passed into.
-> callbacks helps in making our code non-blocking in nature.

program to illustrate callback:-
-------------------------------
let add=function(a,b)
{
    return a+b;
};
let multiply=function(a,b)
{
    return a*b;
};
let userdefined=function(a,b)
{
    console.log(`here are your two numbers back ${a},${b}`);
};
let result=function(num1,num2,callback)
{
    return callback(num1,num2);
};
console.log(result(2,3,multiply));
